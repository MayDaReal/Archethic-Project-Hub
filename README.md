## Introduction
The Archethic Project Hub is a central repository for the Archethic community to share and develop project proposals. Our goal is to foster collaboration and innovation within the community by providing a structured platform for idea development and project management.

## Collaborative Project Proposal Guide
We have created a versioned "Collaborative Project Proposal Guide" to help you structure your project proposals. This guide is designed to evolve based on feedback from the community, ensuring it remains relevant and useful.

**Note:** The guide is located in the "Collaborative Project Proposal Guide" directory because it includes both an English version and a French version.

## Project Proposals
This section contains all the project proposals shared by the Archethic community. Proposals are categorized to make it easier to find projects that align with your interests and expertise.
