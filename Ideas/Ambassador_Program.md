## Decentralized Ambassador Program
**Recap**  
A community-driven framework rewarding verified contributors through a mini-DAO and proof of unique human.

**More Detailed Description**  
This program empowers Archethic advocates worldwide to:
- **Organize meetups**, workshops, or digital events.
- Earn rewards (tokens, perks) for their contributions, validated by the community.
- Prevent Sybil attacks using Archethic’s proof of unique human, ensuring each ambassador is genuinely a distinct individual.

**Key Questions**  
1. **DAO Structure & Tokenomics**  
   - Will ambassadors receive voting power or tokens based on their engagement?  
   - How are budgets allocated for local/regional events?  
2. **Verification Process**  
   - How do new ambassadors join and prove they’re a unique human using biometrics?  
   - What anti-abuse measures exist for repeated sign-ups?  
3. **Success Metrics**  
   - How do we measure the effectiveness of each ambassador’s outreach?  
   - Are there milestone-based rewards or ongoing stipends?  
4. **Community Governance**  
   - Do we hold periodic reviews to assess ambassador performance?  
   - How do we handle conflicts or disputes within the program?
