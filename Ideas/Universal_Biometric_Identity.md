# Universal Biometric Identity System

**Recap**  
A decentralized identity platform leveraging Archethic’s biometric authentication for a passwordless experience.

**More Detailed Description**  
The Universal Biometric Identity System aims to replace traditional password-based logins with a secure, user-friendly biometric alternative. By utilizing Archethic’s technology (e.g., transaction chain, quantum-resistant cryptography, and built-in biometrics), this system would:
- **Provide frictionless authentication** to multiple applications or services (banking, e-commerce, forums, etc.).
- **Eliminate password-related risks** such as phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing.
- **Ensure user privacy** by not storing biometric data in a centralized repository (data remains decentralized and verifiable on Archethic).

**Key Questions**  
1. **Technical Feasibility**  
   - How will biometric data be captured, hashed, and stored (or referenced) on Archethic?  
   - Which devices and biometrics (fingerprint, face, iris) will be supported initially?  
2. **Regulatory & Compliance**  
   - What legal or data protection regulations must be addressed in different jurisdictions?  
   - Are there standards (e.g., GDPR) requiring specific consent or retention policies?  
3. **User Experience & Adoption**  
   - How can we design a seamless UX for onboarding users into the biometric system?  
   - What incentives exist for service providers to integrate a passwordless solution?  
4. **Security & Reliability**  
   - How do we ensure that fraudulent or spoofed biometric data is not registered?  
   - What fallback options exist in case biometric authentication fails?
