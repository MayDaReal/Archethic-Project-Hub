## Decentralized Oracle Network for Web3
**Recap**  
A secure oracle service delivering real-world data (finance, sports, weather, etc.) to dApps built on Archethic.

**More Detailed Description**  
This network aims to solve the “off-chain data” problem. By pulling APIs or data feeds into on-chain smart contracts:
- **dApps** can rely on validated, tamper-proof data flows.
- **Developers** get a straightforward way to integrate external data (market prices, event results).
- **Multiple oracles** can operate in parallel to ensure redundancy and reduce manipulation risks.

**Key Questions**  
1. **Oracle Architecture**  
   - How do we aggregate data from multiple sources and maintain data integrity?  
   - Are we using a reputation system, a staking model, or another incentive to ensure honesty?  
2. **Use Cases**  
   - Which data feeds are most critical for Archethic (currency rates, sports scores, IoT sensors)?  
   - Will we tailor solutions for specific verticals (DeFi, gaming, insurance)?  
3. **Performance & Scalability**  
   - How frequently can oracles update the blockchain without causing congestion or high fees?  
   - What load-balancing mechanisms might we need?  
4. **Governance**  
   - Is there a DAO that governs updates, new data providers, or node operations?  
   - How are disputes resolved if data is inconsistent?
