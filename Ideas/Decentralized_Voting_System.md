## Decentralized Electronic Voting System
**Recap**  
A voting mechanism secured by Archethic’s biometric verification and quantum-resistant blockchain technology.

**More Detailed Description**  
This system aims to provide a tamper-proof, privacy-centric method of conducting elections or referendums—be it for governmental, organizational, or DAO governance. Core features include:
- **Biometric authentication** to ensure only eligible voters participate.
- **Immutability of votes** via Archethic’s transaction chain.
- **Transparent tallying** while preserving voter anonymity.

**Key Questions**  
1. **Voting Process Design**  
   - How will ballots be created, distributed, and submitted on the blockchain?  
   - Is the voting method (ranked choice, single vote, multiple choice) flexible or fixed?  
2. **Anonymity vs. Verification**  
   - How does the system ensure each vote is unique without revealing personal data?  
   - How do we handle contested results or auditing processes?  
3. **Hardware & Infrastructure**  
   - Are physical voting stations needed? If so, how will they be secured?  
   - Can voters participate entirely via mobile or web apps using biometric authentication?  
4. **Legal & Regulatory Concerns**  
   - What legal frameworks govern electronic voting in different countries?  
   - How do we comply with local election laws?
