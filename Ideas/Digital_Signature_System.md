## Blockchain-Based Digital Signature System
**Recap**  
A platform to sign documents electronically using Archethic’s biometric authentication and transaction chain.

**More Detailed Description**  
Traditional digital signatures rely on password-protected private keys or third-party certification authorities. This solution removes those dependencies by:
- **Storing cryptographic proofs** on Archethic’s blockchain.
- Requiring **biometric confirmation** to validate the signer’s identity.
- Maintaining an **immutable record** of signatures for legal or audit purposes.

**Key Questions**  
1. **Integration with Existing Tools**  
   - How to interface with standard document formats like PDF or Word docs?  
   - Are there APIs or plugins to embed signing functionality in other platforms?  
2. **Legal Validity**  
   - Which jurisdictions recognize biometric-backed blockchain signatures as valid?  
   - What regulatory compliance steps are necessary (eIDAS, etc.)?  
3. **Security**  
   - How do we handle signature revocation or multi-signatory workflows?  
   - Can we ensure the system remains fraud-proof if biometric data is compromised?  
4. **User Experience**  
   - How do signers confirm their identity with minimal friction?  
   - Will there be a fallback method if biometric checks fail?
