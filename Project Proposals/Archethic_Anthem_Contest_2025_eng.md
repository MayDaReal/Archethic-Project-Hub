### **Event Retrospective and Improvements for Future Editions**

#### **Outcome of the Event:**
Unfortunately, the contest had **no participants**. This result highlights several key areas for improvement in future editions:

1. **Lack of Financial Incentives:** The absence of a UCO or NFT reward likely reduced participation motivation.
2. **Insufficient Promotion:** A more structured and sustained communication campaign was needed throughout the contest period.
3. **Lack of Guidance for Participants:** Providing tutorials on using AI-powered music tools (Udio, Suno.ai, etc.) could have helped more users feel capable of participating.
4. **Limited Official Support:** The Archethic Foundation did not actively participate, which might have impacted credibility and reach.

#### **Recommendations for Future Contests:**
1. **Introduce UCO Token Rewards** – Offer monetary or tokenized rewards to attract more participants.
2. **Improve Marketing Strategy** – Plan a more aggressive outreach campaign with scheduled reminders.
3. **Create Step-by-Step Tutorials** – Provide video and written guides to assist non-musicians in AI-generated music creation.
4. **Secure Official Support from Archethic Foundation** – Direct involvement from the foundation could enhance credibility and visibility.
5. **Engage Influencers & Partnerships** – Collaborate with content creators, AI music enthusiasts, or blockchain advocates to spread awareness.

#### **Final Thoughts:**
Although this edition did not attract participants, it serves as a valuable learning experience. With strategic adjustments, the **Archethic Anthem Contest 2026** can be a bigger success, engaging more community members and expanding the visibility of Archethic worldwide.

🚀 **Let’s build on this and make next year’s contest a major event!**
